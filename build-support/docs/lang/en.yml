        <p>To use Scratch4TUIO three components are required&colon; ScratchX with the Scratch4TUIO
        extension running, a TUIO sender and the TUIO-Dispatcher, which forwards TUIO messages
        from the sender to the Scratch extension.</p>

        <h3>ScratchX + Extension</h3>
        <p>To run ScratchX a browser with intalled <a
        href="https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/?loc=en">Flash-Player</a> is required. We suggest
        you use <a href="https://chrome.google.de">Google Chrome</a> since it comes with its own
        frequently updated implementation of Flash, which makes the installation of Adobes version
        unnecessary. (<em>Note: There seems to be a problem with the current version of Chrome and
        the Scratch browser extension, which is required for some extensions to work (not
        Scratch4TUIO!). In that case you will need to use a different browser (Firefox) and Adobes
        Flash version.</em>)</p>

        <p>To run the extension just use the link at the top of this page. Alternatively open  <a
        href="http://scratchx.org">ScratchX</a> and choose "Open extension url". Copy the
        Scratch4TUIO extension url into the field and click "Open":</p>

        <h3>TUIO-Dispatcher</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://github.com/caesarion/scratch4tuio-server/releases/latest">TUIO-Dispatcher</a>
        is a Java application, that forwards any TUIo message it reveices to the Scratch4TUIO
        extension running in the browser. After you downloaded the tool it can be run from the
        command line:</p>

        <pre>java -jar scratch4tuio-dispatcher.jar</pre>

        <p>As soon as the dispatcher started, the status ligth in ScratchX should change from yellow
        to green.</p>

        <p>Further information is available in the <a
        href="https://github.com/caesarion/scratch4tuio-server">Readme</a>.</p>

        <h3>TUIO client</h3>
        <p>The last component is a TUIO client, that generates TUIo messages and sends them to the
        dispatcher. An overview of clients can be found on the <a
        href="http://www.tuio.org/?software">TUIO page under &quot;Software&quot;</a>.</p>

        <p>For doing your first tests with Scratch4TUIO, the TUIO simulator is a good choice. A
        simple to use but very powerful client to work with tangible interactions is
